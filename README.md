### Page replacement algorithms

#### Implemented algorithms
 - FIFO (First In First Out)
 - LRU (Least Recently Used)
 - Optimal 


#### Will be implemented
 - Second Chance
 - Random

Memory is simply implemented as a List of frames (or ints which stand for page numbers).
These algorithms simply return the total page fault.
